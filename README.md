# From-Nand-to-Tetris
This repository includes all assignments I did in the course called Nand2tetris("The Elements of Computing Systems" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken).

Nand2Tetris: Build a computer system from the ground up, 
from nand gate(✪) to tetris (the game), 
from hardware to software.

(✪) - nand gate is the fundamental logic gate to build others gates.
